//! TCP stream for non-blocking read and write operations.
//!
//! Provides a non-blocking [`TcpStream`] for client connections.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use reactor::net::tcp_stream::TcpStream;
//!
//! async fn read_and_echo(stream: TcpStream) {
//!     let mut buf = [0u8; 1024];
//!     loop {
//!         match stream.read(&mut buf).await {
//!             Ok(0) => break, // Connection closed
//!             Ok(n) => {
//!                 stream.write_all(&buf[..n]).await.ok();
//!             }
//!             Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// A TCP stream for non-blocking I/O operations.
///
/// `TcpStream` wraps a socket file descriptor and provides async read/write methods.
/// All operations are non-blocking and will yield control to other tasks when data
/// is not immediately available.
///
/// # Methods
///
/// - [`Self::read`]: Read available data (may return 0 or partial data)
/// - [`Self::write`]: Write data (may write less than requested)
/// - [`Self::write_all`]: Write all data, retrying until complete
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut buf = [0u8; 1024];
/// match stream.read(&mut buf).await {
///     Ok(n) if n > 0 => println!("Read {} bytes", n),
///     Ok(_) => println!("Connection closed"),
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
