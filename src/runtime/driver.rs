//! Background runtime driver to pump tasks and I/O.
//!
//! Some user code may block inside the main future (e.g., joining a std::thread),
//! preventing the single-threaded runtime loop from progressing. To avoid hangs,
//! this driver runs the executor and reactor in a dedicated thread so spawned
//! tasks and I/O readiness continue to be processed.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The background driver manages a separate thread that continuously processes tasks
//! and I/O events. This ensures that spawned tasks and network operations make progress
//! even if the main future blocks on synchronous operations.
